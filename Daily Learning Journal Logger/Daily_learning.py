"""
 Challenge: Daily Learning Journal Logger

Build a Python script that allows you to maintain a daily learning journal. Each entry will be saved into a `.txt` file along with a timestamp.

Your program should:
1. Ask the user what they learned today.
2. Add the entry to a file called `learning_journal.txt`.
3. Each entry should include the date and time it was written.
4. The journal should **append** new entries rather than overwrite.

Bonus:
- Add an optional rating (1-5) for how productive the day was.
- Show a confirmation message after saving the entry.
- Make sure the format is clean and easy to read when opening the file.

Example:
ðŸ“… 2025-06-14 â€” 10:45 AM
Today I learned about how list comprehensions work in Python!
Productivity Rating: 4/5
